# Applied Generative AI Fundamentals: Prompt Engineering, Developing Custom GPTs and Multi AI Agent Systems

Welcome to the **Applied Generative AI Fundamentals** repository, organized by **GloVersity (GloProg)**. This repository contains all the work, assignments, and code examples discussed during the **Online Sessions** aimed at helping students strengthen their skills in Generative AI and custom AI model development.

This repository is part of **Quarter 2** of the **Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer** program.

## Overview

The **Applied Generative AI Fundamentals** sessions focus on mastering **Generative AI**, **Prompt Engineering**, **Custom GPT Development**, and **Multi AI Agent Systems**. These sessions will guide you through real-world examples and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your expertise, this repository provides valuable resources.

### Instructors:
- **Abdul Qadir Imran** - Lead Instructor, Cloud Native & MERN Stack Developer
- **Abdullah Iqbal** - Co-Instructor, [Co-Instructor Role]

### Learning Goals:
- Understand **Generative AI** and **Prompt Engineering** techniques
- Learn to create **Custom AI Models** and **GPTs** using OpenAI, Azure, and Google technologies
- Explore automation using open-source libraries like **LangChain**, **CrewAI**, and **LangGraph**
- Develop skills to automate multi-step tasks and business processes typically done by teams

Each folder contains:
- **Lecture notes**
- **Source code** used during live sessions
- **Assignments** to practice and improve your skills
